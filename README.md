# Useful-Calendar
Finally, a useful way to remember what the date is, built with a modern tech stack and boasting a beautiful UI.

I'm sick and tired of having to check what the date is. Whether I am signing something or just wondering when the next episode of Oshi no Ko will come out, I am constantly having to check the date.

So, I designed Useful-Calendar. Relying on a tech stack of Typescript, HTML, and CSS for the frontend and Go for the backend, it actually works a lot faster than you would think... BUT it provides a one-of-a-kind date checking experience by playing exciting music while it loads to encourage you not to make a mistake and different endings based on how you perform. Never again will you be forced to embarrasingly check the date twice within a minute.
