# Useful Calendar

Useful Calendar is an ironically-named webapp that aims to make the process of checking the date tedious and slow while relying on 
a robust tech stack of Typescript, HTML, and CSS for the frontend and a custom Go API for the backend.

Believe it or not, it actually works a lot faster than you would think... BUT it provides a one-of-a-kind date checking experience by playing exciting music while it loads to encourage you not to make a mistake and different endings based on how you perform.
